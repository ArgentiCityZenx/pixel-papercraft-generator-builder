This generator creates a pig papercraft with an optional saddle, helmet, and boots that can be removable.
There are also many customizable options to change the type of head, if the pig is wearing armor or if it is removable, etc.

## Sizing

The saddle, helmet, and boots can vary in texture size, so the generator was made to be as general as possible.

If the helmet is covering the eyes or nose, then either modify the texture file to make it fit better, or
if it is separate after you print it you can trim off the parts that cover the eyes or nose.

## Printing

The accessories page (second page) works the best if printed slightly larger than the pig page so it fits onto the pig better.

In Windows Photo Viewer, this can be solved by unchecking 'Fit picture to frame' when you print the pig page
and Checking 'Fit picture to frame' for the accessories page.
